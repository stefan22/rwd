## bootstrap breakpoints

- bootstrap hardcodes the breakpoints for different viewports
- the intention is to use the mobile-first paradigm
- plan for the smallest screen and make adjustments size gets larger

### the smallest size deals with a width of 0 - 320px

- some browser may never trigger something on the 300s

### extra small devices and phones

- referred to as ***xs***
- any device that has a ***minimum width*** of ***480px***
- most phones fall into this category, even in landscape position

### small devices and tablets

- referred to as ***sm***
- any device that has a minimum width of ***768px***
- most tablet fall into this category, as well as desktop browsers that
  are opened in a small size.

### medium devices and desktops

- referred to as ***md***
- any device that has a minimum width of ***992px***
- this is beyond the size of most tablets or phones ***BUT***
  it is possible that people have set their smaller devices to use a larger
  number(e.g. 992px) to trigger this viewport.

### large devices and wide screens

- referred to as ***lg***
- any device that has a minimum width of ***1200px***
  + the trend toward smaller, smaller, smaller is often reversed to
    larger, larger, larger.
