## RWD

- designing sites with multiple screen sizes/resolutions in mind.
- sites should work under any platform, any browser size, any orientation.
- a small screen ***should not*** mean less content, just things need to be 
  layout more intelligently
- never assume the user won't need access to a functionality

## concepts to consider

- media queries - detecting viewport
- flexible grid-based layout for relative sizing
- flexible images

## RWD options

- responsive web design => fluid measurements, flexible grids, css rules
- adaptive design => returns one of multiple versions of a page based on device
- separate mobile site => separate page URL for mobile
